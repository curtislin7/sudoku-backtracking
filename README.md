# Solving Sudoku Puzzles With Search Based Backtracking Constraint Satisfaction Algorithms 

Sudoku stands as one of the most popular past-times for many across the world. Although one might often find it hard to solve a sudoku puzzle with pen and paper, the solution is quite trivial to attain through a search-based backtracking algorithm. In this paper, we explore several studies that have delved into studying the algorithm that efficiently solves sudoku puzzles. We then proceed to implement our version of the algorithm and discuss the results.
